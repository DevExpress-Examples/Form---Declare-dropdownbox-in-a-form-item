# Form - Declare DropDownBox in a Form item

This example illustrates how to declare a DropDownBox in an item using [templates](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#template):

A Form item uses an embedded DropDownBox editor with the capability to validate its value. Validation is implemented based on the synchronized [dxForm.validationGroup](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#validationGroup) and [dxValidator.validationGroup](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Configuration/#validationGroup). See also: [Data Validation](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/UI_Widgets/Data_Validation/), [Validate and Submit the Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Form/Validate_and_Submit_the_Form/).
